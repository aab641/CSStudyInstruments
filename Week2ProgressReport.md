Hi everyone,

This week I tried testing Preston Moore's rrapper project with mutators, but there were some issues getting it to run the rreplay successfully.
We also got a little sneak peak at his "output_event_number" branch which automatically aligns the strace_out to the binary. Amazing new feature and progress for rrapper.

* Updated the Ubuntu-32 VMware Image to the "output_event_number" branch (snapshots available for earlier builds): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rdnmZaKWYCMpGbwlfIWciIffJkXhRLYe

* Found Error: Invalid Syntax (https://github.com/pkmoore/rrapper/issues/45)

* Found Error: Munmap Required (https://github.com/pkmoore/rrapper/issues/47)
